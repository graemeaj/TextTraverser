# TextTraverser
  Searches Windows file structure for files instantly using a generated text file that indexes all file locations on the HDD and uses powerful search algorithms to find that file fast, which you can open from the windows GUI. It is optimized for mouse use, but searching can be done with keyboard-only input as well, for power users looking to perform tasks quickly. This is a barebones application made to do a specific task, it has low overhead and a small Exe file size. Indexing can take anwhere from **one** second(**~1000 indexed files**) to **30** seconds(**~150,000 files**). after it's loaded into memory, searching time is subsecond (generally **~50 ms**). 

  This was built as a tool to effectively search through Windows OS hard drives quickly, using the explorer search is very very slow because it delves into txt files for content, as well the space isn't indexed to perform a task like this quickly.
